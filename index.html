	Clipped wings, I was a broken thing<br>
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing<br>
You would wind me down<br>
I struggled on the ground, oh<br>
So lost, the line had been crossed<br>
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk<br>
You held me down<br>
I struggle to fly now, oh<br>
But there's a scream inside that we all try to hide<br>
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny<br>
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive, oh<br>
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide<br>
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no<br>
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die, yeah<br>
And I don't care if I sing off key<br>
I find myself in my melodies<br>
I sing for love, I sing for me<br>
I shout it out like a bird set free<br>
No, I don't care if I sing off key<br>
I find myself in my melodies<br>
I sing for love, I sing for me<br>
I'll shout it out like a bird set free<br>
I'll shout it out like a bird set free<br>
I'll shout it out like a bird set free<br>
Now I fly, hit the high notes<br>
I have a voice, have a voice, hear me roar tonight<br>
You held me down<br>
But I fought back loud, oh<br>
There's a scream inside that we all try to hide<br>
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny<br>
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive, oh<br>
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide<br>
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no<br>
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die, yeah<br>
And I don't care if I sing off key<br>
I find myself in my melodies<br>
I sing for love, I sing for me<br>
I shout it out like a bird set free<br>
No, I don't care if I sing off key<br>
I find myself in my melodies<br>
I sing for love, I sing for me<br>
